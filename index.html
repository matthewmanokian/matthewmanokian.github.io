  <p>
    Hi, my name is Matthew. I’m a student learning web development and GitHub.
    This site is part of my coursework where I practice HTML, CSS, and
    version control.

    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <p>
      In Week 2, I learned how to create branches in GitHub, make changes
      without affecting the main branch, and submit pull requests for review.
      I also learned how important clear commit messages are when collaborating
      on projects.
